This repository contains several UI mods for the idle game Trimps.

# Map at Zone I/O
This mod adds import and export functionality to Map at Zone.

# Quia + Wombats UI
This mod is depreciated, as it is now included in the base game!
This is a simple mod that tries to make all buttons more screenreader (and other user) friendly.

## Script installation
### Modloader
If this mod has been added to it, then installation should be through GodNooNoo's [ModLoader](https://github.com/GodNooNoo/TrimpsModLoader).
However, manual installation should be possible through one of the following paths:

### Browser
Create a new Tampermonkey script with the contents of this repository's relevant `.user.js` file, for whatever mods you want to use.

### Steam
Download this repository's `mods.js` file, and place it in the /mods/ folder inside the Trimps folder. This file will load all the currently maintained UI mods on this repository.

More in-depth instructions can be found at the ModLoader's page, if you need them. (Sorry NooNoo, i'm not trying to out-explain you here. you've just done too good a job)
