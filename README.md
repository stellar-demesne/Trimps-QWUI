# Quia + Wombats UI
This is a simple mod that tries to make all buttons more screenreader (and other user) friendly

## Script installation
### Modloader
If this mod has been added to it, then installation should be through GodNooNoo's [ModLoader](https://github.com/GodNooNoo/TrimpsModLoader).
However, manual installation should be possible through one of the following paths:

### Browser
Create a new Tampermonkey script with the contents of this repository's `VoidMapClarifier.user.js` file.

### Steam
Download this repository's `mods.js` file, and place it in the /mods/ folder inside the Trimps folder.

More in-depth instructions can be found at the ModLoader's page, if you need them. (Sorry NooNoo, i'm not trying to out-explain you here. you've just done too good a job)
